                                   Tokens
*******************************************************************************/

// Note that the following tokens are unsupported by the Vault. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but covers
// many common types of tokens that will not work with the Vault architecture. (See https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20
// for examples of token features that are problematic for many protocols.)
//
// * Rebasing tokens (e.g., aDAI). The Vault keeps track of token balances in its internal accounting; any token whose
//   balance changes asynchronously (i.e., outside a swap or liquidity operation), would get out-of-sync with this
//   internal accounting. This category would also include "airdrop" tokens, whose balances can change unexpectedly.
//
// * Double entrypoint (e.g., old Synthetix tokens, now fixed). These could likewise bypass internal accounting by
//   registering the token under one address, then accessing it through another. This is especially troublesome
//   in v3, with the introduction of ERC4626 buffers.
//
// * Fee on transfer (e.g., PAXG). The Vault issues credits and debits according to given and calculated token amounts,
//   and settlement assumes that the send/receive transfer functions transfer exactly the given number of tokens.
//   If this is not the case, transactions will not settle. Unlike with the other types, which are fundamentally
//   incompatible, it would be possible to design a Router to handle this - but we didn't try it. In any case, it's
//   not supported in the current Routers.
//
// * Tokens with more than 18 decimals (e.g., YAM-V2). The Vault handles token scaling: i.e., handling I/O for
//   amounts in native token decimals, but doing calculations with full 18-decimal precision. This requires reading
//   and storing the decimals for each token. Since virtually all tokens are 18 or fewer decimals, and we have limited
//   storage space, 18 was a reasonable maximum. Unlike the other types, this is enforceable by the Vault. Attempting
//   to register such tokens will revert with `InvalidTokenDecimals`. Of course, we must also be able to read the token
//   decimals, so the Vault only supports tokens that implement `IERC20Metadata.decimals`, and return a value less than
//   or equal to 18.
//
//  * Token decimals are checked and stored only once, on registration. Valid tokens store their decimals as immutable
//    variables or constants. Malicious tokens that don't respect this basic property would not work anywhere in DeFi.
//
// These types of tokens are supported but discouraged, as they don't tend to play well with AMMs generally.
//
// * Very low-decimal tokens (e.g., GUSD). The Vault has been extensively tested with 6-decimal tokens (e.g., USDC),
//   but going much below that may lead to unanticipated effects due to precision loss, especially with smaller trade
//   values.
//
// * Revert on zero value approval/transfer. The Vault has been tested against these, but peripheral contracts, such
//   as hooks, might not have been designed with this in mind.
//
// * Other types from "weird-erc20," such as upgradeable, pausable, or tokens with blocklists. We have seen cases
//   where a token upgrade fails, "bricking" the token - and many operations on pools containing that token. Any
//   sort of "permissioned" token that can make transfers fail can cause operations on pools containing them to
//   revert. Even Recovery Mode cannot help then, as it does a proportional withdrawal of all tokens. If one of
//   them is bricked, the whole operation will revert. Since v3 does not have "internal balances" like v2, there
//   is no recourse.
//
//   Of course, many tokens in common use have some of these "features" (especially centralized stable coins), so
//   we have to support them anyway. Working with common centralized tokens is a risk common to all of DeFi.

/**
 * @notice Token types supported by the Vault.
 * @dev In general, pools may contain any combination of these tokens.
 *
 * STANDARD tokens (e.g., BAL, WETH) have no rate provider.
 * WITH_RATE tokens (e.g., wstETH) require a rate provider. These may be tokens like wstETH, which need to be wrapped
 * because the underlying stETH token is rebasing, and such tokens are unsupported by the Vault. They may also be
 * tokens like sEUR, which track an underlying asset, but are not yield-bearing. Finally, this encompasses
 * yield-bearing ERC4626 tokens, which can be used to facilitate swaps without requiring wrapping or unwrapping
 * in most cases. The `paysYieldFees` flag can be used to indicate whether a token is yield-bearing (e.g., waDAI),
 * not yield-bearing (e.g., sEUR), or yield-bearing but exempt from fees (e.g., in certain nested pools, where
 * yield fees are charged elsewhere).
